## Architecture Notes (Permanent Reference)

- [x] **Pipeline routing confirmed (Feb 25, 2026):** Direct 3-stage API calls are ACTIVE. n8n is DORMANT.

  - Stage 2: Anthropic claude-opus-4-5 (draft, 120s timeout)
  - Stage 3: Anthropic claude-opus-4-5 (final assembly, 120s timeout)

## Phase 74: Pipeline Status Sync + Cron Scheduler

- [x] Audited both pipelines: direct API (pipeline.ts) and n8n callback (n8nCallback.ts) for status gaps

- [x] Fixed n8n callback: now transitions researching → drafting → generated_locked (matches direct pipeline)
- [x] Fixed audit log fromStatus/toStatus values to be accurate in n8n callback
- [x] Fixed email URL: both pipelines now use canonical production domain (talk-to-my-lawyer.com)
- [x] Created cronScheduler.ts: in-process node-cron scheduler, runs draft reminders every hour at :00
- [x] Wired cronScheduler into server startup (server/_core/index.ts)
- [x] Set CRON_SECRET via webdev_request_secrets
- [x] Installed node-cron + @types/node-cron
- [x] Tests: 10/10 passing in phase74-pipeline-sync.test.ts, 477/477 total, 0 TypeScript errors

- [x] All 484 tests passing, 0 TypeScript errors
