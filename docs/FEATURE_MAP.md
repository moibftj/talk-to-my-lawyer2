# Talk-to-My-Lawyer — Comprehensive Feature Map

**Version:** 2.0 — February 27, 2026**Author:** Manus AI**Scope:** Complete inventory of all implemented, partially-implemented, and planned features across the Talk-to-My-Lawyer platform.

---

## 1. Platform Overview

Talk-to-My-Lawyer is an AI-powered legal letter drafting platform with mandatory attorney review. Subscribers submit letter requests, a three-stage AI pipeline (Perplexity research, Anthropic drafting, Anthropic assembly) generates drafts, and licensed attorneys edit and approve letters through a dedicated Review Center. The platform enforces a strict paywall: subscribers see a blurred draft preview and must pay $200 for attorney review before any letter is finalized.

---

## 2. Role System

The platform implements four distinct roles, each with scoped access enforced at both the tRPC procedure level and Supabase Row-Level Security.

| Role | DB Enum Value | Access Scope | Dashboard Route |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Subscriber | `subscriber` | Own letters, billing, profile | `/dashboard` |
| Employee | `employee` | Affiliate dashboard, discount codes, commissions, payouts | `/employee` |
| Attorney | `attorney` | Review Center (queue + detail), SLA dashboard | `/attorney` |
| Super Admin | `admin` | Full platform access, user management, jobs, letters, affiliate oversight | `/admin` |

Role assignment happens during onboarding (`/onboarding`) after signup. Employees automatically receive a generated discount code. The `attorney` role was added to the DB enum in Phase 57.

---

## 3. Authentication & Authorization

### 3.1 Auth Provider: Supabase Auth (Phase 35)

Manus OAuth was fully replaced with Supabase Auth in Phase 35. All auth flows use email/password via the Supabase Admin API.

| Feature | Status | Route / Endpoint |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Email/password signup | **Implemented** | `POST /api/auth/signup` |
| Email/password login | **Implemented** | `POST /api/auth/login` |
| Logout (clear cookies) | **Implemented** | `POST /api/auth/logout` |
| Token refresh | **Implemented** | `POST /api/auth/refresh` |
| Forgot password (email) | **Implemented** | `POST /api/auth/forgot-password` |
| Reset password (token) | **Implemented** | `POST /api/auth/reset-password` + `/reset-password` page |
| Email verification | **Implemented** | `POST /api/auth/verify-email` + `/verify-email` page |
| Resend verification | **Implemented** | `POST /api/auth/resend-verification` |
| Role-based route protection | **Implemented** | `ProtectedRoute` component with `allowedRoles` prop |
| Deep-link redirect (`?next=`) | **Implemented** | Login/signup read `?next=` param (Phase 58) |
| Email change with re-verification | **Implemented** | `auth.changeEmail` tRPC mutation (Phase 61) |
| Password change | **Implemented** | `auth.changePassword` tRPC mutation (Phase 60) |
| Onboarding (role selection) | **Implemented** | `/onboarding` page (Phase 41) |

### 3.2 Security Layers

- **Supabase RLS:** 25 policies across 9 tables (Phase 34)

- **tRPC Guards:** `subscriberProcedure`, `employeeProcedure`, `attorneyProcedure`, `adminProcedure`

- **Upstash Redis Rate Limiting:** Auth (10/15min), letters (5/hr), billing (10/hr), global tRPC (60/min) — Phase 63

- **JWT Verification:** Supabase JWT verified on every `/api/trpc` request via `context.ts`

---

## 4. Database Schema

### 4.1 Tables (9 application tables + 1 auth token table)

### 4.2 Enums

| Enum | Values |
| --- | --- |
| `user_role` | `subscriber`, `employee`, `attorney`, `admin` |
| `letter_status` | `submitted`, `researching`, `drafting`, `generated_unlocked`, `generated_locked`, `pending_review`, `under_review`, `approved`, `rejected`, `needs_changes` |
| `letter_type` | `demand`, `cease_and_desist`, `breach_of_contract`, `eviction_notice`, `employment_dispute`, `insurance_claim`, `debt_collection`, `general_legal` |
| `subscription_plan` | `per_letter`, `monthly`, `annual`, `free_trial_review`, `starter`, `professional` |
| `subscription_status` | `active`, `canceled`, `past_due`, `trialing`, `incomplete`, `none` |

### 4.3 Database-Level Atomic Functions (Phase 34)

- `refund_letter_allowance()` — atomic refund on pipeline failure

- `safe_status_transition()` — validates status machine at DB level

- `reset_monthly_allowance()` — monthly credit reset

- `log_letter_status_change()` — audit trigger function

### 4.4 Indexes

Seven spec-required indexes plus three partial performance indexes are applied (Phase 19, Phase 34).

---

## 5. Letter Pipeline (AI-Powered)

### 5.1 Architecture

The pipeline uses **direct API calls** as the primary path. n8n is dormant unless both `N8N_PRIMARY=true` and `N8N_WEBHOOK_URL` are set.

| Stage | Provider | Model | Timeout | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 — Research | Perplexity | `sonar-pro` | 90s | 8-task deep legal research (statutes, case law, SOL, remedies, defenses, enforcement climate) |
| 2 — Drafting | Anthropic | `claude-opus-4-5` | 120s | Professional legal letter draft from research |
| 3 — Assembly | Anthropic | `claude-opus-4-5` | 120s | Final letter assembly combining research + draft |

### 5.2 Status Flow (Simplified — Phase 69)

```
submitted → researching → drafting → generated_locked
                                          │
                                    [Subscriber pays $200]
                                          │
                                          ▼
                                    pending_review → under_review → approved
                                                                  → rejected
                                                                  → needs_changes
```

The `generated_unlocked` status still exists in the DB enum but is no longer set by the pipeline (Phase 69 removed the free-unlock path). All letters now terminate at `generated_locked` regardless of whether it is the subscriber's first letter.

### 5.3 Pipeline Entry Points

| Entry | File | Trigger |
| --- | --- | --- |
| In-app pipeline | `server/pipeline.ts` | `letters.submit` tRPC mutation |
| n8n callback | `server/n8nCallback.ts` | `POST /api/pipeline/n8n-callback` (dormant) |

### 5.4 Research Output Schema (Phase 51)

The Perplexity research stage produces a rich JSON output with: `jurisdictionProfile`, `recentCasePrecedents`, `statuteOfLimitations`, `preSuitRequirements`, `availableRemedies`, `localJurisdictionElements`, `enforcementClimate`, `commonDefenses`, `riskFlags`, `draftingConstraints`.

---

## 6. Stripe Payment Integration

### 6.1 Pricing Model (Phase 67 + Phase 69)

| Plan | Price | Type | Letters |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Per Letter | $200 | One-time | 1 |
| Starter | $499/month | Subscription | 4/month |
| Professional | $799/month | Subscription | 8/month |

The $50 free trial review was removed in Phase 69. All letters now require $200 payment for attorney review.

### 6.2 Stripe Integration Points

| Feature | Status | Implementation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Checkout session creation | **Implemented** | `billing.createCheckout` tRPC mutation |
| Webhook handler | **Implemented** | `POST /api/stripe/webhook` (signature verified) |
| Letter unlock (payment → pending_review) | **Implemented** | Webhook: `generated_locked → pending_review` |
| Subscription management | **Implemented** | Webhook handles `customer.subscription.*` events |
| Billing portal redirect | **Implemented** | `billing.createPortalSession` tRPC mutation |
| Payment history | **Implemented** | `billing.paymentHistory` tRPC query (Stripe API) |
| Receipts page | **Implemented** | `/subscriber/receipts` (Phase 48) |
| Promo code support | **Implemented** | `allow_promotion_codes: true` + discount code field (Phase 68) |
| Commission tracking | **Implemented** | Webhook creates commission_ledger entry on payment with discount code |

### 6.3 Employee Affiliate System (Phase 40 + Phase 68)
