    items: [
      {
        q: "What is Talk to My Lawyer?",
        a: "Talk to My Lawyer is an AI-powered legal letter drafting service with mandatory attorney review. You submit your legal matter through a structured intake form, our AI researches applicable laws and drafts a professional letter, and then a licensed attorney reviews, edits, and approves the final document before you receive it.",
      },
      {
        q: "Is this a substitute for hiring a lawyer?",
        a: "No. Talk to My Lawyer provides attorney-reviewed legal correspondence — not full legal representation. Every letter is reviewed and approved by a licensed attorney, but this service does not create an attorney-client relationship. For complex litigation, criminal matters, or ongoing legal representation, you should retain a licensed attorney in your jurisdiction.",
      },
      {
        q: "What types of legal letters can I get?",
        a: "We currently support: Demand Letters, Cease and Desist Notices, Contract Breach Letters, Eviction Notices, Employment Dispute Letters, Consumer Complaint Letters, and General Legal Correspondence. More letter types are added regularly.",
      },
      {
        q: "Who reviews my letter?",
        a: "Every letter is reviewed by a licensed attorney before delivery. Attorneys review the AI-generated draft, make any necessary edits, and either approve, reject, or request changes. You only receive a letter that has been explicitly approved by a licensed attorney.",
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    category: "Pricing & Payment",
    items: [
      {
        q: "How much does a letter cost?",
        a: "A single attorney-reviewed legal letter costs $200. This covers AI research and drafting, licensed attorney review and editing, and a final approved PDF you can download and use. We also offer subscription plans for users who need multiple letters per month.",
      },
      {
        q: "What does the $200 fee include?",
        a: "The $200 per-letter fee includes: AI-powered legal research using jurisdiction-specific databases, professional letter drafting by our AI pipeline, licensed attorney review and editing, attorney approval and sign-off, and a downloadable PDF of the final approved letter.",
      },
      {
        q: "Do you offer subscription plans?",
        a: "Yes. We offer monthly and annual subscription plans for users who need multiple letters. Subscribers get a set number of letters per billing period at a reduced per-letter cost. Visit our Pricing page for current plan details.",
      },
      {
        q: "What payment methods do you accept?",
        a: "We accept all major credit and debit cards (Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover) through our secure Stripe payment processor. We do not store your card details — all payments are handled securely by Stripe.",
      },
      {
        q: "Can I get a refund?",
        a: "If your letter is rejected by our attorney review team and cannot be revised, you are entitled to a full refund. If you are unsatisfied with an approved letter, please contact our support team within 7 days of delivery and we will work to resolve the issue.",
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    category: "The Process",
    items: [
      {
        q: "How long does it take to receive my letter?",
        a: "Most letters are delivered within 24–48 hours of payment. The AI drafting stage typically completes within 2–5 minutes. Attorney review is the primary variable — attorneys aim to complete reviews within 24 hours during business days.",
      },
      {
        q: "What happens after I submit my request?",
        a: "After submission: (1) Our AI researches applicable laws and statutes for your jurisdiction, (2) The AI drafts a professional letter based on your intake details and research findings, (3) The draft is queued for attorney review, (4) A licensed attorney reviews, edits if necessary, and approves or requests changes, (5) You receive an email notification and can download the approved PDF.",
      },
      {
        q: "Can I see the AI draft before paying?",
        a: "Yes. After the AI completes drafting, you can preview a partially blurred version of your letter. To unlock the full letter and submit it for attorney review, you pay the $200 fee at that point.",
      },
      {
        q: "What if the attorney requests changes?",
        a: "If the reviewing attorney needs additional information or clarification, your letter status will change to 'Needs Changes' and you will receive an email with the attorney's notes. You can then respond with the requested information through your dashboard, and the letter will be re-queued for review.",
      },
      {
        q: "Can I edit the letter after attorney approval?",
        a: "The approved letter is the final, attorney-certified version. If you need modifications after approval, you would need to submit a new letter request. We recommend providing as much detail as possible in your initial intake form to minimize the need for revisions.",
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    category: "Legal Validity & Use",
    items: [
      {
        q: "Are these letters legally valid?",
        a: "Yes. All letters are reviewed and approved by licensed attorneys. The letters are professionally drafted legal correspondence that you can use in real-world situations. However, a legal letter is not a court filing or legal judgment — it is a formal written communication that asserts your legal position.",
      },
      {
        q: "Can I use the letter in court?",
        a: "A demand letter or cease and desist notice can be referenced in legal proceedings as evidence of prior notice. However, if your matter escalates to litigation, you should retain a licensed attorney for full legal representation. Our letters are designed to resolve disputes before court involvement.",
      },
      {
        q: "What jurisdictions do you cover?",
        a: "We currently cover all 50 U.S. states. Our AI research pipeline identifies and applies jurisdiction-specific laws, statutes, and regulations relevant to your letter type and location. International coverage is planned for future releases.",
      },
      {
        q: "Is my information confidential?",
        a: "Yes. All information you provide is treated as confidential. We use industry-standard encryption for data in transit and at rest. Attorneys who review your letters are bound by professional confidentiality obligations. We do not sell or share your personal information with third parties.",
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    category: "Account & Technical",
    items: [
      {
        q: "Do I need to create an account?",
        a: "Yes, you need a free account to submit letter requests, track your letter status, and download approved letters. Creating an account takes less than a minute — just an email address and password.",
      },
      {
        q: "How do I track my letter's progress?",
        a: "Your subscriber dashboard shows real-time status updates for all your letters. You can see exactly which pipeline stage your letter is in — from AI research through attorney review to final approval. You also receive email notifications at key milestones.",
      },
      {
        q: "Can I download my approved letter?",
        a: "Yes. Once your letter is approved by an attorney, a download button appears on your letter detail page. The letter is delivered as a professionally formatted PDF with letterhead.",
      },
      {
        q: "What if I have a question not answered here?",
        a: "Contact our support team through the dashboard or email support@talk-to-my-lawyer.com. We typically respond within one business day.",
